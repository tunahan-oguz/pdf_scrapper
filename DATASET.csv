3438,dataset/images/15.pdf/page_591_image_1.png,Stages in the cell division cycle of Enterococcus hirae The diplococcus in a is in the process of growing a new wall at its crosswall and segregating its nuclear material N to the two nascent daughter cocci In rapidly growing exponential phase cultures before completion of the central crosswall new sites of wall elongation are established at the equators of each of the daughter cells at the junction of the old polar wall stippled and the new equatorial wall beneath a band of wall material that encircles the equator b Beneath each band a mesosome M is formed while the nucleoids separate and the mesosomes at the central site are lost The mesosomes appear to be attached to the plasma membrane by a thin membranous stalk B1 Invagination of the septal membrane appears to be accompanied by centripetal crosswall penetration B2 A notch is then formed at the base of the nascent crosswall creating two new wall bands B3 Wall elongation at the base of the crosswall pushes the newly made wall outward At the base of the crosswall the new wall peels apart into the peripheral wall pushing the wall bands apart B4 When a sufcient new wall is made so that the wall bands are pushed to a subequatorial position eg from C to A to B a new crosswall cycle is initiated Meanwhile the initial crosswall centripetally penetrates into the cell dividing it into two daughter cocci At all times the body of the mesosomes appears to be associated with the nucleoid Doubling of the number of mesosomes seems to precede completion of the crosswall
